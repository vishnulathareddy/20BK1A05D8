CODE-
  import React ,{useEffect, useState }from 'react';
const TrainList = () => {
  const [trains, setTrains] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchTrains();
  }, []);

  const fetchTrains = async () => {
    try {
      // Make a request to your API endpoint to fetch train data
      const response = await fetch('/api/trains');
      const data = await response.json();

      setTrains(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching trains:', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Train Availability</h1>
      {trains.length > 0 ? (
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Train Number</th>

                <td>{train.train_number}</td>
